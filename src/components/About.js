        <h2>Welcome to My Corner of the Web</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! Iâ€™m Joel Diaz, an enthusiastic and dedicated software engineer
          with a passion for technology and a drive for continuous learning.
          Although I am just starting my professional journey in the tech
          industry, I have a solid foundation in programming and software
          development, cultivated through my education and personal projects.
        </p>

        <h2>My Journey So Far</h2>
        <p>
          My interest in technology began at a young age, fueled by curiosity
          and a love for problem-solving. This passion led me to pursue a degree
          in Computer Science from York College, where I honed my skills in
          various programming languages and software development methodologies.
          My academic projects and personal projects have provided me with
          hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of the software
          development lifecycle.
